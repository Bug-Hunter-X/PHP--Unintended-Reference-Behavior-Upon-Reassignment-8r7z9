To avoid this issue, understand that simply reassigning a reference does not modify the original object.  If you intend to modify the original object indirectly through a reference, ensure you don't reassign that reference to a new object.  If you need to create a copy of the object, use cloning:

```php
class MyClass {
    public $value = 0;
}

$obj1 = new MyClass();
$obj2 = &$obj1;

$obj2->value = 10;

echo $obj1->value; // Outputs 10

$obj2 = clone $obj1; // Create a copy instead of reassigning
$obj2->value = 20;

echo $obj1->value; // Outputs 10.  $obj1 remains unchanged
echo $obj2->value; // Outputs 20
```

Cloning creates a new independent object, preventing unexpected side effects from reference reassignment.  Always be mindful of when you are using references and when you need independent copies to ensure predictable program behavior.
